Welcome! This is your first task. Since you're new to this format of programming, we have to learn. This format is used in competitions, and don't worry, it's not anything too complicated.

Unlike your unfortunate peers who have to actually read files for their inputs and write to files for your outputs. 

Your inputs will already be set up as parameters in your function **workplace()**.
Details of each parameter will be shown below, such as *datatype* and *name*.

You simply return your output with the *return* function.

This problem deals with Pretty cool. **Do your research, google is your friend.**

For additional help, either ask Paul, Joshua, Mr. Blatner, or any other staff member for assistance. We would be able to go over them during the club. **It can be an anonymous request if you would like.**
